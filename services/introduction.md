description: Documentation for sending via SMTP or HTTP with the SparkPost API.

# SparkPost API
There are two service types available:  [SparkPost](http://sparkpost.com/), our self-service product, and [SparkPost Elite](https://www.sparkpost.com/products/sparkpost-elite), a managed service with guaranteed burst rates and white-glove support. These services have shared and unique aspects, with those unique aspects indicated in our consolidated API documentation as follows:
* Features specific to **SparkPost** are indicated as "SparkPost only".
* Features specific to **SparkPost Elite** products are indicated by "SparkPost Elite only".

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint   | Use for |
|------------|---------|
| `https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1` | SparkPost |
| `https://yourdomain.sparkpostelite.com/api/v1` | SparkPost Elite |
| `https://yourdomain.msyscloud.com/api/v1` | SparkPost Elite (prior to June 2015) |

Note: To prevent abuse, our servers enforce request rate limiting, which may trigger responses with HTTP status code 429.

## API Conventions
* API versioning is handled using a major version number in the URL, e.g. /api/v1/endpoint.
* /something is equivalent to /something/.
* URL paths, URL query parameter names, and JSON field names are case sensitive.
* URL paths use lower case, with dashes separating words.
* Query parameters and JSON fields use lower case, with underscores separating words.
* The HTTP status indicates whether an operation failed or succeeded, with extra information included in the HTTP response body.
* All APIs return standard error code formats.
* Unexpected query parameters are ignored.
* Unexpected JSON fields in the request body are ignored.
* The JSON number type is bounded to a signed 32-bit integer.

## Authentication
* To authenticate with the APIs, specify the "Authorization" header with each request. The value of the Authorization header must be a valid API key or basic auth with the API key as username and an empty password.
* Administrators can [generate an API key](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/credentials). Please take care to record and safeguard your API keys at all times. You cannot retrieve an API key after it has been created.
* For examples of supplying the Authorization header, refer to the cURL example below or any of the individual API request examples.

## Using Postman

If you use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) you can click the following button to import the SparkPost API as a collection:

[![Run in Postman](https://s3.amazonaws.com/postman-static/run-button.png)](https://www.getpostman.com/run-collection/81ee1dd2790d7952b76a)

## Using cURL
If you are using cURL to call the API, you must include the resource URI in quotes when you pass in multiple query parameters separated by an `&`.

For example:

```
curl -v \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: 14ac5499cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf" \
-X GET "https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/metrics/deliverability/aggregate?campaigns=testjob&from=2014-01-23T14:00&metrics=count_targeted,count_sent,count_accepted&timezone=America%2FNew_York&to=2014-06-23T15:50"
```

or

```
curl -v \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-u <APIKey>: \
-X GET "https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/metrics/deliverability/aggregate?campaigns=testjob&from=2014-01-23T14:00&metrics=count_targeted,count_sent,count_accepted&timezone=America%2FNew_York&to=2014-06-23T15:50"
```

## Subaccounts
<a name="subaccounts-intro"></a>
With the introduction of subaccounts, some of the APIs are now able to store and retrieve information at a more granular level.
Subaccounts are a way for service providers to provision and manage their customers separately from each other and to provide assets and reporting data.

The following APIs have subaccount support:

* [Metrics API](metrics.html) **(Note: Not available for Subaccount API keys)**
* [Message Events API](message-events.html)
* [Sending Domains API](sending-domains.html)
* [Suppression List API](suppression-list.html)
* [SMTP API](smtp-api.html)
* [Transmissions API](transmissions.html)
* [Tracking Domains API](tracking-domains.html)

### Terminology
* Master Account - This refers to a Service Provider and their data
* Subaccounts - This refers to a Service Provider's customer(s), and that customer's data

### Managing subaccount data as a Service Provider
* Master Accounts can set `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` with the ID of their subaccount to manage subaccount data on their behalf
  * For example, on a GET request to `/api/v1/sending-domains`, setting `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` to `123` will only return sending domains which belong to Subaccount `123`
  * The same applies to data management, setting `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` to `123` on a POST request to `/api/v1/sending-domains` will create a sending domain belonging to Subaccount `123`
* `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` is not required, but if provided, must be a number

### Managing master account data as a Service Provider
* Setting `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` to `0` will retrieve or manage Master Account data only
* For POST/PUT/DELETE requests, omitting `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` will result in the same behavior as setting `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` to `0`
* For GET requests, omitting `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT` will result in Master Account and Subaccount data in the response
  * Subaccount data will have the key `subaccount_id` in the response object
* Metrics and Message Events APIs do not use `X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT`. Instead, setting the query parameter `subaccounts` to `0` will return only Master Account reporting data

## SMTP Relay Endpoints
<a name="smtp-relay-endpoints"></a>

### SparkPost SMTP Endpoint
To use SparkPost as an SMTP relay you need to point your SMTP client (or local MTA) to the following endpoint:

* Host: smtp.sparkpostmail.com
* Port: 587 or 2525
* Encryption: STARTTLS
* Authentication: AUTH LOGIN
* User: SMTP_Injection
* Password: Any API key with Send via SMTP permission
* To inject mail to an SMTP relay endpoint on behalf of a subaccount, modify your SMTP injection username to include the subaccount ID.
  * For example, use `SMTP_Injection:X-MSYS-SUBACCOUNT=123` to send as a Subaccount, having an ID of 123.
  * The Master Account's API key is still used as the password when sending on behalf of a Subaccount.
  * When sending on behalf of a Subaccount, the Subaccount's Sending Domain must be used.

**Note**: Port 2525 is provided as an alternate port for cases where port 587 is blocked (such as a Google Compute Engine environment).

### SparkPost Elite SMTP Endpoint

* Please contact your Technical Account Manager for details on your SMTP endpoint.

The SMTP relay optionally supports advanced API features using the [SMTP API](smtp-api.html).  To create an API key, login to your SparkPost [Account Credentials](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/credentials) page.
