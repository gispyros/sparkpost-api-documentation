# SparkPost API v1
SparkPost API enables client applications to integrate with SparkPost and perform actions associated with account management, message generation, and reporting.

## SparkPost API Endpoint
**https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1**

JSON is the basis for its request input and response format.

## API Conventions
* API versioning is handled using a major version number in the URL, e.g. /api/v1/endpoint.
* /something is equivalent to /something/.
* URL paths, URL query parameter names, JSON field names, and XML element names are case sensitive.
* URL paths use lower case, with dashes separating words.
* Query parameters and JSON fields use lower case, with underscores separating words.
* The HTTP status indicates whether an operation failed or succeeded, with extra information included in the HTTP response body.
* All APIs return standard error code formats.
* Unexpected query parameters are ignored.
* Unexpected JSON fields or XML elements in the request body are ignored.
* The JSON number type is bounded to a signed 32-bit integer.

## Authentication
All API's require that you authenticate with every request.

To authenticate with the various API's, specify the "Authorization" header with each request.
The value of the "Authorization" header must be a valid API key.
Administrators can generate an API key using the UI. 

Please take care to record and safeguard your API keys at all times. You cannot retrieve an API key after it has been created.

For examples of supplying the Authorization header, refer to the cURL example below or any of the individual API request examples.

## Using cURL
If you are using cURL to call the API, you must include the resource URI in quotes when you pass in multiple query parameters separated by an **&**.

For example:

```
curl -v \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: 14ac5499cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf" \
-X GET "https://api.sparkpost.com/api/v1/metrics/deliverability/aggregate?campaigns=testjob&from=2014-01-23T14:00&metrics=count_targeted,count_sent,count_accepted&protocols=smtp&timezone=America%2FNew_York&to=2014-06-23T15:50"
```
