# Group Webhooks

The Webhooks API provides the means to create, review, update, and delete webhooks, which enables you to
receive push updates of the raw events generated by SparkPost and SparkPost Elite.

The following are key operational details: 
* Any webhook batch that does not receive an HTTP 200 response will be retried for a total of 4 hours before the data is discarded.
* Each webhook batch contains the header X-MessageSystems-Batch-ID, which is useful for auditing and prevention of processing duplicate batches.
* Webhooks posting to your endpoint will timeout after 10 seconds. For best results, write webhook batches to disk and then process asynchronously to minimize data loss if you have a problem with your database.

## Webhooks Object Properties

| Property          | Type   | Description | Required | Notes |
|-------------------|--------|-------------|----------|-------|
| name              | string | User-friendly name for webhook | yes | example: `Example webhook` |
| target            | string | URL of the target to which to POST event batches | yes |  When a webhook is created or updated with a change to this property, a test POST request is sent to the given URL. The target URL must accept the connection and respond with HTTP 200; otherwise, your request to the Webhook API will fail with HTTP 400, and the requested change will not be applied.<br />example: `http://client.example.com/example-webhook` |
| events            | array  | Array of event types this webhook will receive | yes | Use the Webhooks Events endpoint to list the available event types.<br />example: `["delivery", "injection", "open", "click"]`|
| auth_type         | string | Type of authentication to be used during POST requests to target | no | examples: `oauth2`, `none` |
| auth_request_details | JSON | Object containing details needed to request authorization credentials, as necessary | no | example: `{ "url": "https://oauth.myurl.com/tokens", "body": { "client_id": "<oauth client id>", "client_secret": "<oauth client secret>" }}`|
| auth_credentials         | JSON | Object containing credentials needed to make authorized POST requests to target | no | example: `{ access_token: "<oauth token>", expires_in: 3600 }` |
| auth_token        | string | Authentication token to present in the X-MessageSystems-Webhook-Token header of POST requests to target | no | Use this token in your target application to confirm that data is coming from the Webhooks API. <br />example: `5ebe2294ecd0e0f08eab7690d2a6ee69`<br /><br />_Note: This field is deprecated, you should use the auth_type field instead._ |

## Create [/webhooks]

### Create a Webhook [POST]

Create a webhook by providing a **webhooks object** as the POST request body.  On creation, events will
begin to be pushed to the target URL specified in the POST request body.

As described in "Webhooks Object Properties", webhook creation entails a test POST request to the URL given as the _target_ value. If this request does not receive an HTTP 200 response, your request to the Webhook API will fail with HTTP 400, and the webhook will not be created. If created successfully, the webhook will begin to receive event data after 1 minute.

## Update and Delete [/webhooks/{id}]

### Update a Webhook [PUT]

Update a webhook's properties by specifying its id in the URI path and use a **webhooks object** as
the PUT request body.

Note that batches currently queued for delivery to this webhook will not be affected by these
modifications.  For example, if you change the webhook's target URL, batches already queued for delivery will still be POSTed to the previous URL.

As described in "Webhooks Object Properties", a change to the _target_ value entails a test POST request to the URL given. If this request does not receive an HTTP 200 response, your request to the Webhooks API will fail with HTTP 400, and the webhook will not be modified.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, uuid, `12affc24-f183-11e3-9234-3c15c2c818c2`) ... UUID identifying a webhook

+ Request (application/json)

  + Headers

  + Body

    ```js
    {
      "name": "Renamed webhook",
      "events": [
        "rejection",
        "delay"
      ],
      "auth_type": "none"
    }
    ```

+ Response 200 (application/json)

    ```js
    {
      "results": {

            "method": ["POST"]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```

### Delete a Webhook [DELETE]

Delete a webhook from the system by specifying its id in the URI path.  The system will stop pushing data to the target URL after the batches currently queued to be
delivered are drained.

+ Parameters
  + id (required, uuid, `12affc24-f183-11e3-9234-3c15c2c818c2`) ... UUID identifying a webhook

+ Request

  + Headers
      Authorization: 14ac5499cfdd2bb2859e4476d2e5b1d2bad079bf

+ Response 204

## Validate [/webhooks/{id}/validate]

### Validate a Webhook [POST]

The validation sends an example message event batch from the Webhooks API to the
target URL, validates that the target responds with HTTP 200,
and returns detailed information on the response received from the target.

#### Message Properties
