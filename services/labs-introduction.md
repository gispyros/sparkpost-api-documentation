# Group Sparkpost Labs

We love to experiment with new ideas at SparkPost!
Through SparkPost Labs we make available to users new API and App functionality and other helpful tools.
Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when you try out anything marked as “Labs”:


* API functionality is available under the `/api/labs/` path rather than `/api/v1/` path.
* There is no guarantee that Labs functionality will be backwards compatible - we may need to change the API behavior or discontinue it without notice. Some labs functionality may eventually be incorporated into our core supported product.
* Normal Support channels and SLAs are not available for SparkPost Labs APIs. Please refer to the Community Slack channel of #sparkpostlabs to ask questions or provide feedback. Your questions and feedback are very important to us, and we encourage comments on our Labs APIs. You can also provide feedback via [this Google form.](https://goo.gl/forms/dPKabjKTmPGNLLCq1)
