# Group SparkPost Labs

We love to experiment with new ideas at SparkPost!
With SparkPost Labs, our engineers share new API and App functionality and other helpful tools. Here are some helpful tips to keep in mind when you try out anything marked as “Labs”:

* Labs API functionality is not versioned. As such, it is available under a distinct `/api/labs/` path rather than `/api/v1/` path. 
* Any API feature accessed via `/api/labs/` is by definition **experimental and subject to change**. We may decide to change the behavior or **discontinue it at any time**. We also may decide to incorporate Labs functionality into the core supported product.
* **Normal support channels or SLAs are not available for SparkPost Labs**. You can provide feedback via [this Google form](https://goo.gl/forms/qvTW9BbmQFsFTZB03). We will route your feedback to our engineeringing and product teams.
