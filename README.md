# SparkPost API Documentation

## Prerequisites

* You have installed [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) on your development machine
* You have installed [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) on your development machine

The SparkPost API Docs in Apiary Blueprint format (based on Markdown)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

```git clone https://github.com/SparkPost/sparkpost-api-documentation```

2. Change into the directory

2. We use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) for our task runner, so you will also have to install Grunt globally

```npm install -g grunt-cli```

3. Install the dependencies

```npm install```

## Development

### Grunt Commands

#### Apiary Blueprint Validator

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can execute the Apiary Blueprint Validator tests in the following ways:

* Run the test on ALL /services/ files sequentially
  ```grunt testFiles```

* Run the test an individual /services/ file
  ```grunt shell:test:<filename>```

#### Compile and Test

* Concatenate ALL /services/ files into a single apiary.apib file, then test the compiled file
  ```grunt compile```
